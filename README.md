## 3 Unique inputs
+ I had a text input for the user's first name and last name 
+ I had a radio button for the user to submit their birthday month
+ I had a checkbox that when checked, it reversed the pirate name that was output to the page.

## Class
+ Form.php
+ PirateName.php: The PirateName class was used to generate the pirate name based on user input.

## Code style divergences
+ None

## Notes for instructor
+ I added a new public function to Form.php (getLetter) which 
returns the first letter of the input and converts it to 
uppercase. I needed to get this information for the first name
and last name form inputs.
